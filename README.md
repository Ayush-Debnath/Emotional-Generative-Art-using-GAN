# 🎭 Emotion2Art CGAN 🎨

**Emotion2Art** is an AI-powered generative art project where emotions aren’t just felt — they’re turned into art. Using a **Conditional GAN (CGAN)** trained on labeled emotion datasets, this model creates unique visual pieces based on the emotional input you give it.

---

## 🧠 What It Does

- 🤖 Takes an **emotion** input (like *angry*, *happy*, *sad*, etc.)
- 🎨 Generates original artwork that reflects the emotion
- 🗃️ Trained on emotional labels using the **AffectNet** and **WikiArt** datasets
- 🛠️ UI built with **Streamlit** for instant art generation

---

## 💥 Key Features

- 🧬 Trained from scratch using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**
- 🎨 CGAN model that learns conditional generation based on emotion labels
- 🖼️ Interactive UI to input emotions and visualize generated art in real-time
- 📊 Customizable sliders for style tweaking (coming soon)

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

- `Python`
- `TensorFlow` + `Keras`
- `Streamlit` (for frontend UI)
- `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib` (for data munging and previews)

---

## 🧾 Datasets Used

- **AffectNet** – Emotion-labeled face images
- **WikiArt** – Artwork data including genre, style, artist info
- Each image is tagged with an `emotion_label` and mapped to a corresponding piece of art
